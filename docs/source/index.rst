Welcome to BasketBot's documentation!
=====================================

BasketBot is a prototype tool for automating the collection of prices from retail websistes across the world to calculate `Consumer Price Index <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp>`_-like indices for different regions. Key goals of BasketBot are:

- Be low maintenance, using intelligent algorithms to robustly locate prices on retail sites despite potential changes to site architectures.
- Provide easy-access to the generated CPI-like data, including visualizations.

See the :ref:`overview` the a more detailed outline of the project
